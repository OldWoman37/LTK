THOSE PRIOR ENHANCEMENTS AND SEVERAL NEWFEATURES,  IN ADDITION  TO A  FEW MINOR 'BUG' FIXES.      тHIS RELEASE FIXES THREE BUGS:  1)   мерге IS NO LONGER HARD-CODED TO     ACCESS DEVICE #8, BUT WILL DEFAULT     TO THE DEVICE NUMBER PRESENTLY     ASSIGNED TO THE лT. кERNAL.  2)   тHE DIRECTORY-GENERATOR FOR THE     '$' CHANNEL NOW PROPERLY LISTS THE     FILE NAMES OF FILES WHICH ARE     GREATER THAN 999 BLOCKS IN LENGTH.     пREVIOUSLY, THE FILE-SIZE WAS     LISTED PROPERLY,  BUT THE FILENAME     WAS LEFT BLANK.   тHIS BUG ONLY AFFECTED THE DIRECTORY LISTING OBTAINED BY READING THE '$'CHANNEL,  AND  NOT THE LISTING OBTAINED VIA THE дир COMMAND.  3)   а HALF-STEPPING FAILURE DURING     ERROR-RECOVERIES IN фастцопы HAS     BEEN FIXED.  иT IS NOW  POSSIBLE     TO RECOVER

  (A) еьец  FILES  ARE  NO  LONGER LIMITED TO 4 BLOCKS.  тHEY MAY NOW BEAS LONG AS 127 BLOCKS.       (B) а  пи  SIGN  FOLLOWED BY ANY BYTE отхер THAN A PI SIGN WILL CAUSE UPTO A 4  SECOND PAUSE OF

FRIENDLYENHANCEMENTS.   1.) а SLIGHT CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE SERIAL BUS "аутолоад" FEATURE.  уPTILL NOW, IF YOU HAD "аутолоад" ENABLED IN цонфиг AND A LOAD REQUEST WAS PASSEDOND  TO A  FLOPPY THAT WAS TURNED  офф, YOUR PROGRAM WOULD  GET BACK  A "дежиценот пресент" ERROR.   тHIS PATCH CAUSES THE "филе нот фоунд" ERROR TO BEREPORTED INSTEAD. тHIS WAS DONE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS THAT DO A триаллоад  TO  CHECK FOR  THE  PRESENCE OF A FILE, AND DO нот EXPECT TO GET A DEVICEERROR.   нOW, WHEN  YOU DON'T NEED YOUR FLOPPY, YOU CAN LEAVE IT TURNED оффINSTEAD OF HAVING  TO REPEATEDLY CHANGE YOUR "аутолоад" OPTION IN цонфиг.   2.) тHIS NEXT FEATURE IS ONE WE HAVE HAD MANY REQUESTS FOR OVER THE YEARS.фOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION, IT IS A USER DEFINABLE алтернате дирецт модеCOMMAND PROCESSOR.     еXAMPLE:  лET'S  SAY  THAT  INSTEAD  OF  TYPING "фастцопы" YOU'D LIKE TO TYPE "фц", ORPERHAPS "у1" INSTEAD OF "усер 1".  тHIS FEATURE PERMITS YOU TO DEFINE YOUR овнCOMMANDS, AND THE дос ACTIONS THEY WILL REPRESENT.  тHE FEATURE USES A кеы филе  FOR FAST TRANSLATION, AND ALLOWS YOU TO DEFINEUP  TO  225 OF YOUR OWN  CUSTOM  дирецт моде COMMANDS AND/OR лк дос COMMANDEQUIVALENTS.  тHE кеыс CAN BE FROM 1 TO 4 CHARACTERS LONG,  WHICH MAY BE LINKEDTO ANY CORRESPONDING ацтион STRING FROM 1 TO 26 CHARACTERS LONG.  иN ADDITION,  EACH  алтернате COMMAND CARRIES WITH IT AN ацтион флаг WHICHCONTROLS WHETHER YOU WANT THE ALTERNATE COMMAND TO BE PERFORMED AS SOON AS YOUHIT ретурн OR TO HAVE IT  дисплаыед  ON THE SCREEN AND TO PAUSE UNTIL YOU PRESSретурн AGAIN.  тHIS FEATURE GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO SEE AND MODIFY THE COMMANDBEFORE YOU ACTUALLY EXECUTE IT.  бEFORE  YOU  DEFINE  YOUR DIRECT MODE алтернатес, IT IS импортант THAT YOUUNDERSTAND HOW THE  лT. кERNAL PERFORMS A дирецт моде SEARCH.  вHEN A STRING OFCHARACTERS  (WITHOUT LEADING SPACES) IS ENTERED, THE FOLLOWING ордер OFSEARCHES MAY TAKE PLACE:       A. фIRST, A SEARCH IS DONE ON          лу 10  усер 0.  иF FOUND AND          IT IS AN EXECUTABLE FILE THEN          CONTROL IS GIVEN TO IT.       B. иF FILE IS нот FOUND ON лу 10          усер 0 анд YOUR алтернате          COMMANDS ARE енаблед, тHEN          A SEARCH OF YOUR алтернатес          IS PERFORMED AND EXECUTED IF          ONE EXISTS.       C. фINALLY, IF COMMAND STILL нот          FOUND, THEN YOUR CURRENT лу          AND усер IS SEARCHED.  тHIS CONCEPT IS  IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND SO THAT YOU дон'т ENTER ANалтернате кеы WITH THE  саме  NAME AS A FILE OR дос COMMAND THAT алреады EXISTSON  лу 10 усер 0.   иF YOU DO DUPLICATE AN лу 10 COMMAND, THE алтернате WILLнот BE ACTED UPON.  хAVING UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT (WE HOPE), LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO SET UP AND USETHIS FEATURE.       A. цопы: ыOU MUST COPY THE FILE          CALLED "алтед" TO YOUR HARD          DRIVE (USE фастцопы OR цопы-          алл).  дO THIS WHILE IN ц64          MODE TO INSURE ITS FILE

FOR THE EXISTANCE OF YOURкеы FILE.  иF IT DOES нот EXIST,  IT IS AUTOMATICALLY BUILT FOR YOU.  аS WEMENTIONED,  THIS IS A  кеы филе  AND IT WILL BE BUILT ON лу 10 усер 0 UNDER THENAME "усер.алтернатес".   тHIS FILE CAN BE COPIED AND/OR MOVED TO OTHER луS FORBACK-UP  PURPOSES.   хOWEVER,  IT  муст RESIDE ON лу 10 усер 0 TO USE THEалтернате COMMANDS DEFINED IN IT.импортант -

 аLSO, YOU MAY  TURN ON  AND  TURN OFF YOUR алтернатес FEATURE WITH THEFOLLOWING дирецт моде COMMANDS:       "алтд" AND RETURN TO дисабле                    OR       "алте" AND RETURN TO енабле  ыOUR  цуррент  он/офф STATUS  WILL BE REFLECTED BY THE ASTERISK INDICATOR ATALL TIMES.   аLSO, THIS SETTING WILL BE REMEMBERED BY THE дос EVEN IF YOUREBOOT YOUR SYSTEM.   3.) тHERE HAS  BEEN A

дос,  THE  дир  PROCESSOR HAS BEEN ENHANCED SO THAT THE LISTINGPRODUCED IN  THE ц-128  80-COLUMN  MODE OCCURS MUCH FASTER.  аLL THE PATCHESRELEASED EARLIER HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO 'LINEAR CODE' IN THIS дос.  тHE MOST  NOTICABLE IMPROVEMENT IS IN фастцопы.  иN FACT, IT'S BEEN ENTIRELYREWRITTEN.   тHERE ARE  SUFFICIENT  NEW FEATURES IN фастцопы, ALONE TO MAKE UPAN ENTIRE дос UPDATE.  иMMEDIATELY  UPON  INVOKING фастцопы, YOU WILL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE:  ыOU MAYNOW  специфы тхе дежице нумбер  OF  THE FLOPPY DRIVE ON WHICH фастцопы WILLRUN.  иF A DISKETTE DRIVE IS PRESENT AT THE DEVICE ADDRESS YOU SPECIFY, IT WILLBE IDENTIFIED BY TYPE.   тHAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT, VERY DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTTO фастцопы; DRIVES SUPPORTED.  тHE фастцопы NOW SUPPORTS:     1).  1541'S.     2).  1571'S IN THE 1541 MODE.     3).  1571'S IN THE NATIVE, DOUBLE-          SIDED MODE.                        4).  1581'S.  тHAT'S RIGHT:   фастцопы NOW SUPPORTS алл тхрее STANDARD цOMMODORE SERIALDRIVES.  уSING A 1581 ON A ц-128,  IT'S INCREDIBLY FAST.  иN FACT, фастцопы CANFILL AN ALREADY-FORMATTED 1581 DISKETTE (3160 BLOCKS плус 40 BLOCKS OF бам ANDINDEX)  IN UNDER THREE MINUTES,  TWENTY-FIVE SECONDS.  фастцопы HAS  BEEN  HEAVILY TESTED ON THE FOLLOWING DRIVES/CONFIGURATIONS:     1 ) нтсц AND пал ц-64'S     2 ) ц-64'S, FLAT ц-128'S AND ц-128         'д' MODELS.     3 )

YOUARE PRESENTED WITH A FAMILIAR  фастцопы MENU, WITH A COUPLE OF VISIBLE CHANGES.  1) тHE SELECTED DRIVE IS IDENTIFIED.  2) тво нев мену итемс APPEAR.  тHE NEW MENU ITEMS ARE:     а) ф3 - дискетте дуплицатор     б) ф4 - реселецт сериал дриже  тHE ф4 OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO SPECIFY A NEW FLOPPY DRIVE WITHOUT LEAVING THEфастцопы MENU.  тHE ф3 OPTION IS A  POWERFUL TOOL FOR SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTERS AND FOR DISKETTEMAINTENANCE.   иT ALLOWS  YOU TO CREATE A COPY OF A SINGLE DISKETTE SURFACE INоне пасс, USING A WORK-FILE ON THE  лT. кERNAL AS A HOLDING BUFFER.  ыOU ARE  ALLOWED  TO  VERIFY  OR  NOT VERIFY YOUR COPIES.  ыOU ARE ALLOWED TOSPECIFY THE  FILE NAME  OF  THE HOLDING FILE.  иF THE FILE DOES  NOT EXIST,фастцопы WILL CREATE IT, AND PROCEED TO COPY THE SOURCE DISKETTE INTO THE FILE.  аFTER  THE SOURCE DISKETTE IS COPIED, YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO INSERT A DESTINA-TION DISK  INTO THE  FLOPPY DRIVE,  AND THE ENTIRE DISKETTE SURFACE IS CREATEDIN A SINGLE PASS. аFTER THE DESTINATION COPY HAS FINISHED, YOU'RE ASKED IFYOU'D LIKE TO MAKE  анотхер цопы OF THE SAME DISKETTE.  тHIS IS  A PERFECT  TOOL FOR SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTERS  WHO  HAVE  MANY IDENTICALCOPIES TO PRODUCE.  бUT THERE IS A MORE POWERFUL FEATURE HERE WAITING TO BEEXPLOITED.  аFTER A DISKETTE HAS BEEN COPIED WITH THE дуплицате FUNCTION OF фастцопы, THEHOLDING FILE IS ретаинед.   лATER, WHEN YOU SPECIFY A HOLDING-FILE NAME FOR Aдуплицате OPERATION, YOU MAY ре-усе THE SAME FILE.  иF YOU DO, YOU HAVE THECHOICES OF READING A  нев DISKETTE INTO THE FILE, OR гоинг дирецтлы то тхе дестинатион пхасе  OF  THE COPY.   тHIS ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE IDENTICAL COPIESOF A DISKETTE AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND ONLY REQUIRES YOU TO READ THE ORIGINAL DISKонце.  тHE  DUPLICATOR  MODE WAS INTENDED TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ONLY ON UNPROTECTEDDISKETTES;  THAT IS,  DISKETTES WITH NO INTENTIONAL ERRORS.   фастцопы CANPROCEED PAST SOME ERRORS, BUT THEY WILL нот BE DUPLICATED ON THE DESTINATIONDISKETTE.    тHE  DUPLICATOR  MODE  WAS INTENDED TO BE A фаст, еасы MODE FORMASS DUPLICATION OF DISKETTES.  тHE REMAINING  FUNCTIONS OF  фастцопы WILL BE FAMILIAR,  BUT THEY HAVE BEENSIGNIFICANTLY  'CLEANED UP',  AND  HAVE A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN THEIR FLOW.  ыOUNEED TO BE AWARE OF THE CHANGES,  SINCE THEY AFFECT YOUR PERCEPTION OF HOW THECOPYING PROCEEDS,  AND  реяуире цхангес TO ANY еьец FILES USED TO DRIVE THEфастцопы PROCESS.   тO THAT END,  WE'VE TESTED TO ENSURE THAT фастцопы ISеьец-ABLE ON  BOTH THE ц-128 AND ц-64.  оNE IMPORTANT FEATURE HAS BEEN ADDED TOTHE ресторе MODE TO BETTER SUPPORT еьец DRIVEN COPIES. хERE ARE THE ADDITIONS TO THE фастцопы бацкуп AND ресторе MODES:   1)  иN BOTH бацкуп AND ресторе, THE     лу AND усер RESPONSES WILL DEFAULT     TO THE цуррент лу AND усер.  иF     YOU CHANGE THEM, THE CHANGES WILL     BE RETAINED, SO THAT YOU DO NOT     NEED TO RE-TYPE THEM THE NEXT TIME     THAT PROMPT IS ENCOUNTERED.   2)  иN THE ресторе MODE, YOU ARE     PERMITTED TO SPECIFY о(RIGINAL) OR     д(IFFERENT) DESTINATION лу/усер     THAN THAT FROM WHICH THE DISKETTE     WAS CREATED.  тHE оRIGINAL ENTRY     AUTOMATICALLY ROUTES FILES TO THE     SAME лу AND усер FROM WHICH THEY     CAME.   3)  тHE алл усерс OPTION IS NOW     PERMISSABLE DURING бацкуп.  тHIS     FEATURE ALLOWS YOU TO BACK UP AN     ENTIRE лу IN ONE COPY SESSION,     WITHOUT HAVING TO MANUALLY SPECIFY     EACH усер PARTIION.  тHE FILES ARE     AUTOMATICALLY TAGGED ON THE FLOPPY     WITH THEIR SOURCE лу AND усер SO     THAT THEY MAY BE рестореD TO THE     SAME PLACE LATER.  идентицал филе-     намес FROM MULTIPLE усерS аре     алловед ON THE SAME DESTINATION     DISKETTE.   4)   мORE FILE-TYPE SELECTIONS ARE      AVAILABLE AT THE TYPE-MATCH      OPTION.  ыOU MAY NOW SPECIFY THE      FILE-TYPES BY нумбер OR леттер      TYPE.      тHE TYPES SUPPORTED NOW INCLUDE      басиц (б) OR м/л (м) TYPES, AND      еитхер (п) IN THE ресторе MODE.      аDDITIONALLY, фастцопы NOW ALLOWS      THE бацкуп AND рестореING OF кеы      AND цонтигуоус TYPES (TYPE 4 AND      TYPE 5 FILES).        кеы AND цонтигуоус TYPES ARE      BACKED UP AS уср FILES ON THE      FLOPPY DRIVE TO RETAIN цOMMODORE      COMPATIBILITY.  тHEY ARE TAGGED      WITH THEIR CHARACTERISTICS SO      THEY MAY BE PROPERLY ресторед.  иMMEDIATELY UPON ENTERING THE ресторе OPTION, YOU ARE GREETED WITH A NEWPROMPT:   тHE  филе-еьистс интержентион OPTION.  иT'S NOT AS COMPLEX AS IT MAYSOUND.  тHIS FEATURE WAS ADDED TO ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE фастцопы FROM еьецFILES.  тHIS ITEM ALLOWS YOU TO SPECIFY WHAT ACTION TO TAKE AUTOMATICALLY IFфастцопы  DETECTS THAT  THE  FILE BEING рестореD ALREADY EXISTS ON THE DESTINATION лу/усер.   ыOU  MAY SPECIFY THAT фастцопы с(KIP) OR р(EPLACE) THEFILES ON THE DESTINATION.   нO  PROMPTS WILL BE ISSUED FOR THOSE CHOICES DURINGTHE COPY, SO THAT еьец MAY PROCEED EVEN WHEN UNANTICIPATED FILES ARE FOUNDDURING рестореS.  ыOU  MAY  SELECT THE  мануал  MODE OF INTERVENTION INSTEAD OF THE AUTOMATICMODE.  тHEN  фастцопы  WILL PROMPT  YOU FOR A CHOICE OF ACTIONS WHEN PRE-EXISTING FILES ARE ENCOUNTERED.  ыOU ARE GIVEN A MUCH  RICHER ARRAY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO ALTER THE FLOW OFфастцопы DURING BOTH бацкуп AND ресторе OPERATIONS.  пAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ALLTHE NEW PROMPTS,  AND  THE PLACES WHERE YOU NOW HAVE THE CHANCE TO BACK UP ASTEP, OR QUIT ENTIRELY.   тHE  POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS ARE MUCH GREATER IN NUMBERAND MUCH FRIENDLIER TO THE USER.  пLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING:  дURING  доубле  сидед 1571  AND  1581 FORMAT PASSES, THE FORMAT APPEARS MUCHSLOWER THAN  BEFORE. тHERE'S A лот море спаце TO FORMAT!  тHE 1581 HAS OVER 4AND ONE-HALF  тимес THE CAPACITY OF THE 1541.  оF COURSE, THE 1571 HAS TWICETHE CAPACITY OF A  1541,  SINCE IT USES THE SAME DISKETTES, BUT IN A DOUBLE-SIDED MODE OF OPERATION.  дURING 40-COLUMN COPIES WITH THE
