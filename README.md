# What's this project? 
A re-sourcing of the ROM and SYSGEN files for the LTK HD controller.

# What are the overall goals of this project? 
* Complete removal of serial/drive geometry/dos checksum checks (COMPLETE)
* Complete re-sourcing of the ROM and SYSGEN, documentation of the DOS (IN PROGRESS)
* A custom ROM for the host adapter containing tools for repairing LTK-formatted drives
* Expansion of the DOS to use larger drives, more compatible fastloaders
